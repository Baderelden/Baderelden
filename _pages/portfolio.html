	<p>My research interests are in the area Machine Learning (ML), Data Mining, Combinatorial 
		Optimisation and Genetic Programming. I have experience working with industries 
		on adopting and developing applied machine learning methods 
		[<a href="https://www.freshrelevance.com/blog/price-affinity-predictor/">example</a>]. 
		I have been involved in several industrial Knowledge Transfer Partnerships. </p>

	<p>One of the research areas that I am interested in is developing and applying ML methods for 
		early outcome prediction in real-world applications such 
		<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1386505617303581">Intinsivve Care Units</a> 
		data and <a href="https://www.freshrelevance.com/blog/advanced-testing-optimization/https://www.freshrelevance.com/blog/advanced-testing-optimization/">Digital Marketing</a>. 
		I am working on developing methods to tackle the problem of class-imbalance in ML data. 
		Also, I have interest in hyper-heuristic and genetic programming for the automatic heuristics design.
