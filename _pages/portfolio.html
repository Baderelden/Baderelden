<p class="myTex">My research interests lie at the intersection of Machine Learning (ML), Data Mining, Combinatorial Optimisation, and Genetic Programming. I bring a wealth of experience in working with various industries, fostering the adoption and development of applied machine learning techniques. This experience includes multiple industrial Knowledge Transfer Partnerships, where I've been actively involved in bridging the gap between academia and industry.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="myTex"> One primary research focus of mine is the creation and application of ML methodologies for early outcome prediction in real-world scenarios. Notably, I'm engaged in enhancing the utilization of data from Intensive Care Units and the digital marketing sector. These pursuits aim to facilitate rapid and accurate predictions, thereby improving healthcare outcomes and marketing efficiency. A critical problem that draws my attention in ML is class imbalance in data sets. I am keenly invested in pioneering techniques to alleviate this issue, aiming to optimize ML models' performance when dealing with imbalanced classes.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="myTex"> In addition, I hold a keen interest in hyper-heuristics and genetic programming, specifically in the realm of automatic heuristic design. This interest dovetails with my commitment to advancing the automation capabilities within the field of machine learning, driving efficiency and innovation in problem-solving.&nbsp;</p>
